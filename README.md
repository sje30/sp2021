# Scientific Programming 2021

This is the home page for the Scientific programming course.  There is
also the [moodle
page](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=228882) but I will
tend to update this page more often.

Live lectures will be held on Teams in the "MATHS_MPhil Computational
Biology 2021-22"channel , and recorded.  Recordings are available on
[Panopto](https://cambridgelectures.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=3c6afa11-8d52-45f2-9b38-adb00100a1a0).

## Consent for recordings

Live lectures will be recorded, and we assume that if you have your
camera or microphone on, then you consent to being recorded.  If you
wish to revoke your consent, please contact us and we will need to
edit you out of the recording.
